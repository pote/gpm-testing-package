## What's this?

Remember [gpm](https://github.com/pote/gpm)? The package version manager for Go? 

Ok, this package is only intended to be used in the test suite for gpm, that's why you'll see pretty much
only a Version function and a lot of git tags.


## Should I care about this package?

No, not really, unless you are a great person and are currently sending me a Pull Request for gpm, if that's the case
feel free to send me PRs to this repo and I'll merge them, they won't screw up current tests, since the whole thing is about testing
versioning differences in packages, so go have fun!
